# We had a hard time understand what the question was asking for question 2. 
# Therefore, we did a jump command so that we can jump easily from question to question.
# To end each question we put a syscall at the end.

# Question 2
# Question 1 of hw1
q1:
li $t0, 2 #load 2 to the register t0
li $t1, 3 #load 3 to the register t1
li $t2, 4 #load 4 to register t2
add $v0, $t0, $t1 #2+3 stored in register v0
add $v0, $v0, $t2 # 5+4 stored in resgister v0

li $v0, 10
syscall

#Question 2 of hw1
q2:
addi $t0, $zero, 7 #load 7 to the register t0
addi $t1, $zero, 1 #load 1 to the register t1
sub $v0, $t0, $t1 #7 subtracted by 1, stored in register v0

li $v0, 10
syscall

# Question 3
q3:
li $t1, 4
li $t2, 3

sub $t2, $t1, $t2
sub $t1, $t1, $t2
